# EInclude

The mjml-core package allows you to include external mjml files to build your email template.
You can wrap your external mjml files inside the default mjml > mj-body tags to make it easier to preview outside the main template.
The MJML engine will then replace your included files before starting the rendering process.

Other file types
You can include external css files. They will be inserted the same way as when using a mj-style.
You need to specify that you're including a css file using the type="css" attribute.
If you want the css to be inlined, you can use the css-inline="inline" attribute.

You can also include external html files. They will be inserted the same way as when using a mj-raw.
You need to specify that you're including a html file using the type="html" attribute.
